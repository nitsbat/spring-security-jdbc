*************************************** Spring security with JDBC **************************

JDBC means the storing of credentials or the authentication are different.
It can be either OAuth, JDBC, credentials, inMemory, LDAP,etc.
Hence in H2 we have a default schema but spring security gives us the ability to create our
choice schema also.
When we made our own type schema and tables, do remember that in resources the table creation script should be
schema.sql and the data insertion script should be data.sql


Now if we have the different schema , we can tell the spring security to look into these schema rather than the
default schema , it is done by using the two  methods
1) usersByUsernameQuery("select username,password,enabled from <table_name> where username = ?")
2) authoritiesByUsernameQuery("select username,authority from <table_name> where username = ?")
